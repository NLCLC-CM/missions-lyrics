        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        This is my Father's world,<br>
        And to my listening ears<br>
        All nature sings, and round me rings<br>
        The music of the spheres.<br>
        This is my Father's world:<br>
        I rest me in the thought<br>
        Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas;<br>
        His hand the wonders wrought.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        This is my Father's world,<br>
        The birds their carols raise,<br>
        The morning light, the lily white,<br>
        Declare their maker's praise.<br>
        This is my Father's world,<br>
        He shines in all that's fair;<br>
        In the rustling grass I hear Him pass;<br>
        He speaks to me everywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
        This is my Father's world.<br>
        O let me ne'er forget<br>
        That though the wrong seems oft so strong,<br>
        God is the ruler yet.<br>
        This is my Father's world:<br>
        why should my heart be sad?<br>
        The Lord is King; let the heavens ring!<br>
        God reigns; let the earth be glad!

        <h1 id="so-will-i">So Will I (100 Billion X)</h1>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        God of creation<br>
        There at the start, before the beginning of time<br>
        With no point of reference<br>
        You spoke to the dark and fleshed out the wonder of light
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus 1]</strong><br>
        And as You speak<br>
        A hundred billion galaxies are born<br>
        In the vapour of Your breath the planets form<br>
        If the stars were made to worship, so will I<br>
        I can see Your heart in everything You've made<br>
        Every burning star, a signal fire of grace<br>
        If creation sings Your praises, so will I
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        God of Your promise<br>
        You don't speak in vain, no syllable empty or void<br>
        For once You have spoken<br>
        All nature and science, follow the sound of Your voice
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus 2]</strong><br>
        And as You speak<br>
        A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath<br>
        Evolving in pursuit of what You said<br>
        If it all reveals Your nature, so will I<br>
        I can see Your heart in everything You say<br>
        Every painted sky, a canvas of Your grace<br>
        If creation still obeys You, so will I<br>
        So will I, so will I
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
        If the stars were made to worship, so will I<br>
        If the mountains bow in reverence, so will I<br>
        If the oceans roar Your greatness, so will I<br>
        For if everything exists to lift You high, so will I<br>
        And if the wind goes where You send it, so will I<br>
        If the rocks cry out in silence, so will I<br>
        If the sum of all our praises still falls shy<br>
        Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times!
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
        God of salvation<br>
        You chased down my heart through all of my failure and pride<br>
        On a hill You created<br>
        The light of the world abandoned in darkness to die
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus 3]</strong><br>
        And as You speak<br>
        A hundred billion failures disappear<br>
        Where You lost Your life so I could find it here<br>
        If You left the grave behind You, so will I<br>
        I can see Your heart in everything You've done<br>
        Every part designed in a work of art called love<br>
        If You gladly chose surrender, so will I<br>
        I can see Your heart, eight billion different ways<br>
        Every precious one, a child You died to save<br>
        If You gave Your life to love them, so will I
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Tag]</strong><br>
        Like You would again a hundred billion times<br>
        But what measure could amount to Your desire?<br>
        You're the One who never leaves the one behind
        </p>

        <h1 id="mercy">Mercy</h1>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        I will kneel in the dust<br>
        At the foot of the cross<br>
        Where mercy paid for me<br>
        Where the wrath I deserve<br>
        It is gone, it has passed<br>
        Your blood has hidden me
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        Mercy, mercy<br>
        As endless as the sea<br>
        I'll sing Your hallelujah<br>
        For all eternity
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        We will lift up the cup<br>
        And the bread we will break<br>
        Remembering Your love<br>
        We were fallen from grace<br>
        But You took all our shame<br>
        And nailed it to a cross
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
        May I never lose the wonder<br>
        Oh, the wonder of Your mercy<br>
        May I sing Your hallelujah<br>
        Hallelujah, Amen<br>
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
        I will kneel in the dust<br>
        At the foot of the cross<br>
        Where mercy paid for me

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        Savior I come<br>
        Quiet my soul remember<br>
        Redemption's hill<br>
        Where Your blood was spilled<br>
        For my ransom<br>
        Everything I once held dear<br>
        I count it all as loss
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        Lead me to the cross<br>
        Where Your love poured out<br>
        Bring me to my knees<br>
        Lord I lay me down<br>
        Rid me of myself<br>
        I belong to You<br>
        Lead me, lead me to the cross
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        You were as I<br>
        Tempted and trialed<br>
        Human<br>
        The word became flesh<br>
        Bore my sin and death<br>
        Now you're risen<br>
        Everything I once held dear<br>
        I count it all as loss
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
        To your heart<br>
        To your heart<br>
        Lead me to your heart<br>
        Lead me to your heart

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        There's a place where mercy reigns and never dies,<br>
        There's a place where streams of grace flow deep and wide.<br>
        Where all the love I've ever found,<br>
        Comes like a flood,<br>
        Comes flowing down.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        At the cross<br>
        At the cross<br>
        I surrender my life.<br>
        I'm in awe of You<br>
        I'm in awe of You<br>
        Where Your love ran red<br>
        and my sin washed white.<br>
        I owe all to You<br>
        I owe all to You Jesus.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        There's a place where sin and shame are powerless.<br>
        Where my heart has peace with God and forgiveness.<br>
        Where all the love I've ever found.<br>
        Comes like a flood,<br>
        Comes flowing down.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
        Here my hope is found<br>
        Here on holy ground<br>
        Here I bow down<br>
        Here arms open wide<br>
        Here You save my life<br>
        Here I bow down<br>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        God sent His son, they called Him Jesus<br>
        He came to love, heal, and forgive.<br>
        He lived and died to buy my pardon,<br>
        An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        Because He lives, I can face tomorrow.<br>
        Because He lives, All fear is gone.<br>
        Because I know He holds the future,<br>
        And life is worth the living just because He lives.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        How sweet to hold a newborn baby,<br>
        And feel the pride and joy he gives.<br>
        But greater still the calm assurance,<br>
        This child can face uncertain days because He lives.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
        And then one day I'll cross the river,<br>
        I'll fight life's final war with pain.<br>
        And then as death gives way to victory,<br>
        I'll see the lights of glory and I'll know He lives.

        <p>
        <strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
        You split the sea<br>

        My fears are drowned in perfect love<br>
        You rescued me<br>
        And I will stand and sing<br>
        I am a child of God

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        One day when Heaven was filled with His praises<br>
        One day when sin was as black as could be<br>
        Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin<br>
        Dwelt among men, my example is He<br>
        Word became flesh and the light shined among us<br>
        His glory revealed
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        Living, He loved me<br>
        Dying, He saved me<br>
        Buried, He carried my sins far away<br>
        Rising, He justified freely forever<br>
        One day He's coming<br>
        Oh glorious day, oh glorious day
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain<br>
        One day they nailed Him to die on a tree<br>
        Suffering anguish, despised and rejected<br>
        Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He<br>
        Hands that healed nations, stretched out on a tree<br>
        And took the nails for me
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
        One day the grave could conceal Him no longer<br>
        One day the stone rolled away from the door<br>
        Then He arose, over death He had conquered<br>
        Now He's ascended, my Lord evermore<br>
        Death could not hold Him, the grave could not keep Him<br>
        From rising again

        Wandering into the Night<br>
        Wanting a Place to Hide<br>
        This weary Soul,<br>
        This Bag of Bones<br>
        And I Tried with all my Mind<br>
        And I just can’t Win the Fight<br>
        I’m Slowly Drifting,<br>
        Ooh Bag of Bone<br>
        And just when I Ran out of Road<br>
        I met a Man I didn’t know<br>
        And he told me that<br>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
        這天同聚於主聖殿，來數算我主恩典；<br>
        祂賜盼望重生的泉源，還給我勇氣面對挑戰！
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus 1]</strong><br>
        恩典太美麗，無甚麼可取替，<br>
        唯求將心全然給主來彰顯主愛多珍貴；<br>
        終生愛神，傾心傾意愛別人，才覺生命沒有枉費！
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 3]</strong><br>
        這天降服於主腳前，留心聽我主差遣；<br>
        深信這日勞苦不徒然，神終會賜我榮美冠冕！
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus 2]</strong><br>
        衷心去讚頌神極重的恩惠，<br>
        獻我一生傳揚福音，來證實主愛何寶貴；<br>
        請觀看稻田，主的莊稼在面前，遼闊收成沒法估計！
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Tag]</strong><br>
        忠於使命，不惜一切來回應，能事奉你是最尊貴！！

        <p>
        <strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
        神差愛子，人稱祂耶穌，祂賜下愛，醫治寬恕，<br>
        死裡復活，使我得自由，那空墳墓就是我得救的記號。
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
        因祂活著，我能面對明天，因祂活著，不再懼怕，<br>
        我深知道，祂掌管明天，生命充滿了希望，只因祂活著。

        <h1 id="new-you">全新的你</h1>

        <p>
        你說陰天代表你的心情，雨天更是你對生命的反應。<br>
        你說每天生活一樣平靜，對於未來沒有一點信心。<br>
        親愛朋友，你是否曾經曾經觀看滿天的星星，<br>
        期待有人能夠瞭解你心，能夠愛你賜你力量更新。<br>
        耶穌能夠叫一切都更新，耶穌能夠體會你的心情，<br>
        耶穌能夠改變你的曾經，耶穌愛你耶穌疼你，<br>
        耶穌能造一個全新的你。
